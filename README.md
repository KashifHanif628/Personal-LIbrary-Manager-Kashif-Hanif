## 📚 Personal Library Manager

## 🎯 Objective

The Personal Library Manager is a simple yet powerful command-line application built in Python to help users manage their personal book collection efficiently. It allows users to add, remove, search, display, and track reading progress of books stored in a local file (library.txt).

## 🚀 Features

✅ Add Books – Store book details including title, author, genre, year, and reading status.

✅ Remove Books – Delete books from the library by title.

✅ Search Books – Find books by title or author.

✅ Display All Books – View all stored books with their details.

✅ Track Reading Progress – Check the total number of books and percentage read.

✅ Data Persistence – Uses a local library.txt file to store book details for future use.
